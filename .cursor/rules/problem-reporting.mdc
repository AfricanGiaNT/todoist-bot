Write a Report with File Details and Issues:

Before concluding any coding or development task, write a report detailing all files involved and the problems encountered.

List All Files:

Include a comprehensive list of all files generated or modified during the task, ensuring each file is clearly named.

Describe File Functions:

For each listed file, provide a brief description of what it does and its purpose within the project.

Document Problems Encountered:

Detail any problems or challenges you encountered during the task, including errors, unexpected behaviors, or limitations.

Explain Solutions or Workarounds:

If problems were resolved, explain the solutions or workarounds you applied; if unresolved, note them for my attention.

Format the Report:

Present the report in a clear, structured format (e.g., markdown) with sections for files, functions, and issues, making it easy for me to review.

Submit for Review:

Provide the completed report to me for review once finished, ensuring I have a full understanding of the task's progress and status.
