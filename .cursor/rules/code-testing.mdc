Write Code Incrementally:  
Before starting any coding, write code incrementally, in small chunks of Edit-Test loops.  

Define a Small Task:  
Define a small task or feature increment for you to focus on.  

Write a Failing Test:  
Write  a test case that fails for this increment.  

Instruct You to Write Code:  
write test code that will pass the test.  

Run the Test:  
run the test.  

Analyze and Fix if Failed:  
If the test fails, analyze the failure and attempt to fix the code, looping back to the previous step.  

Review Changes:  
Once the test passes, I will review the changes as the developer.
