Create a Plan:  
Before starting any work, create a clear and detailed plan in markdown format.  

Ask Clarifying Questions:  
Ask me  and yourself any clarifying questions you need in order to fully understand the task before generating the plan.  

Critique Your Plan:  
After you generate the plan, critique your own plan for completeness, clarity, and potential issues.  

Revise if Needed:  
If your critique reveals any gaps or improvements, revise and regenerate the plan as needed.  

Document the Plan:  
Add the finalized plan to instructions.md, or whatever current step of the plan we are on, so it can be referenced throughout the project.  

Refer Back Frequently:  
Refer back to the plan in instructions.md  or relevant md file frequently during the project to ensure you stay aligned with the goals.
